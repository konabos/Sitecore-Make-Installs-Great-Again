# Sitecore: Make Installation Great Again (MIGA)

**MIGA is an open source tool** created to ease the burden of just getting Sitecore installed anywhere without any fuss. Why should iOS and Android developers be the only ones that make installation simple via the App Stores? It's 2021 and we landed a Rover on Mars, surely we can use some AI and ML to just make this happen? Of course we can, we just need to dream enough, and set an Easter deadline with chocolate being confiscated if the goal is not met!

We have developed the ulimate installer for Sitecore, providing a GUI wizard driven option, advanced user mode, auto-discovery mode and even the option to utilise Sitecore AI and power of Cortex and Machine Learning to self install without you having to lift a finger. We even did Mike Reynolds laundry along the way!
