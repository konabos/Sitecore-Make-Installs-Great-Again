Sitecore Make Installs Great Again (MIGA 1.4)

1. Fast Start
You can start with opening the solution file, choosing the MIGA.Tool project as startup one and hit F5

2. Source code 
Application source code is divided into two groups: Core and UI. The core functionality is abstract enough to be invoked by any type of user interface like web service, cli or win32 gui. The UI functionality may use UI API so it may be impossible to reuse it in different environment. 

3. Documentation
There is a documenation that describes some key parts of the architecture, please check it here:
